=======================

Clearly written code. It's good to see multiple modules, howwver it's a little
akward the way you have chosen to split things up. There's not really a need for
a header file just for all the #includes your program needs, nor for helper
functions. You should try to factor out groups of related functions and types
into their own modules instead.
